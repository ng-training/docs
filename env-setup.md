# Instructions on how to setup the development environment

1. Go to [nodejs downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and pick a package specific for your operating system.
Any version above v6.0 will work, so you can easily pick latest stable one (usually the one from the top links).
Once installed you can check that it works by typing 'node -v' and 'npm -v' in a terminal.

2. Once nodejs and npm are installed, one can install angular-cli by running 'npm i -g angular-cli' in a terminal.
Make sure you have admin rights on Windows or it might fail otherwise. 
If you run into any problems you can check the [official documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation).

3. To install Git you can fetch the package that you need from the [git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
If you prefer to work with a GUI client you can check [those listed here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

4. You can use whatever editor / IDE you want. We'll use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/specials/webstorm/webstorm.html) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
but just as easilly you can use Atom, IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Notepad or whatever suits you.
