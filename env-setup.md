## Setup development environment

_Note: in all cases the download urls should preselect the corresponding version of the software that is recommended for your OS._

1. Install **NodeJS** from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Choose the latest stable version (LTS) which is recommended for most users. NodeJS installer will also install the official Node Package Manager, NPM for short.
You can check what version of NodeJS you have installed by typing `node -v` and for NPM by typing `npm -v` in a terminal.

2. Once you have NodeJS and NPM up and running, install **Angular CLI** by running `npm i -g @angular/cli` in a terminal.
Once installed you can check that it works by typing `ng version` in a terminal.

3. Install **Git** from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
On top of this, if you prefer to work with Git using a GUI client you can check those listed [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

4. Install **Visual Studio Code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com). While you are of course free to use the editor of your choice, we **recommend** that you use the same editor as we do through this course, this way we will avoid any environment issues that you may encounter which are usually hard to fix.
