# Instructions on how to setup the development environment

1. Go to [nodejs downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and pick a package specific for your operating system.
Install the LTS version that is recommended for most users.
Once installed you can check that it works by typing 'node -v' and 'npm -v' in a terminal.

2. Once nodejs and npm are installed, one can install angular CLI by running 'npm i -g @angular/cli' in a terminal.
Make sure you have admin rights on Windows or it might fail otherwise. 
If you run into any problems you can check the [official documentation](https://cli.angular.io/).

3. To install Git you can fetch the package that you need from the [git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
If you prefer to work with a GUI client you can check [those listed here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

4. Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com).
