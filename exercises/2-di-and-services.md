## Dependency Injection and Services

1. Create a logger service which logs to the browser console:
- use the browser console API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/console) log, info, warn, error
- create it in the shared folder along the Employee service
- add it to providers inside the app module
- inject it inside Components and other Services
- log actions with it :)
